            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A briefe Relation of the Life and Conversation of JACOB BOEHMEN, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by learned men called TEUTONICUS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>ACOB BOEHMEN was borne in the yeare 1575. at old <hi>Seidenberg,</hi> about two miles distant from <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> a City lying in Upper <hi>Lusatia,</hi> which is commended in the Writings of learned men: His parents were <hi>Jacob</hi> his father, and <hi>Ursula</hi> his mother, both poore country people. In his youth he kept cattell, and afterwards by the counsell of his friends was sent to Schoole, where he gate to learne to write and reade to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the feare of God, and after that was put to the Trade of a Shoo-maker; wherein when he became a Master (<hi>Anno</hi> 1594.) he married a mayd, one <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> the daughter of one <hi>John Kunshman</hi> of <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> a Butcher, with whom he lived peaceably and well thirty yeares, and had by her foure sonnes, who also learned handicrafts.</p>
            <p>This man, being from his youth up addicted to the feare of God, and being a willing hearer of Sermons, was at length stirred up by that <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Promise</hi> of our <hi>Saviours</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 11. vers. 13. <hi>Your heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit to them that aske him for it</hi>) likewise
<pb facs="tcp:196473:2"/>through the differences and controversies in <hi>Religion</hi> (in which he knew not how to satisfie himselfe) was so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he in the simplicity of spirit, ardently and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly asked, sought and knocked, that he might know the <hi>Truth;</hi> whereby according to the <hi>Divine Drawing</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> hee was in spirit rapt into the <hi>Holy Saboath;</hi> where he remained seven whole daye by his own confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in highest <hi>Ioy.</hi> Afterwards, when he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and had layd aside the folly of youth, he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Divine Zeale</hi> to reprehend very earnestly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Scandalous and Blasphemous Speeches, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himselfe from all unseemly actions with earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for the Love of vertue, by which practice and life, seeing it was cleane contrary to the way and course of the world, he became only their scorne and derision; in the meane time he maintained himselfe with the labour of his hands, in the sweat of his browes, till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Sixt Seculum</hi> namely the year 1600, when he was a second time possessed with a <hi>Divine Light</hi> and by a sudden sight of a <hi>Pewter Vessell</hi> he was brought to the inward ground or <hi>Centrum</hi> of the hidden <hi>Nature.</hi> But he yet somewhat mistrusting, went out into an open field, and there beheld the <hi>Wonder-workes</hi> of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the Signatures of all created things, very cleerly and manifestly laid open: whereupon he was taken with exceeding <hi>Ioy,</hi> yet held his peace in silence, praised God, and in the meane time contented himselfe therewith.</p>
            <p>But according to Gods holy counsell, who manageth his work in secret, after ten yeares, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1610. through the <hi>Overshadowing</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> he was a third time touched by God and renewed. Whereupon, when hee became so enlightned, lest so great grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him, should slip out of his memory, or he
<pb facs="tcp:196473:3"/>resist his God, he wrote privately and secretly for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, by small meanes, and no bookes at all but only the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> These Workes following, <hi>viz.</hi>
